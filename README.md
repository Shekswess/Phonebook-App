# Phonebook-Project

-This Project(App) is made for one big company that needs help about their phonebook.

-The goal of this Project is to make something simple but effective project(App). 

-This Project(App) is made with combination of several languages:

-For the basic design I'm using HTML5 with combination of Bootstrap4.

-For the data I'm working with SQL, to be precise with MySQL.

-For the table, sorting, pagination and searching through the table I'm working with jQuery, to be precise with jQuery plug-in called DataTables.

-To try this project you will need XAMPP or something similar to run a server, for the sql database and for the webApp, because it's made in PHP. You will also need to create a SQL Database with the name phonebook and import a SQL Query named mytable with the help of phpMyAdmin.

-This App is for internal usage of the company. The idea for the project is great for every big company, mostly because the company will not waste employees anymore on managing a big excel sheet with telephone numbers and can relocate those employees on other places, which means less expenses and freeing some resources.
